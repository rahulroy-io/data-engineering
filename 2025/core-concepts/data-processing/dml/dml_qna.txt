Data Cleaning:

Handling missing values: Filling in missing data with appropriate values (e.g., averages, most frequent values, or custom logic).
Identifying and removing outliers: Detecting and excluding data points that deviate significantly from the norm.
Correcting data inconsistencies: Resolving errors in data formats, values, or relationships.
Removing duplicates: Identifying and eliminating redundant records.
Data Formatting:

Data type conversions: Converting data from one data type to another (e.g., string to date, integer to float).
Date and time formatting: Ensuring consistency in date and time representations.
Unit conversions: Standardizing units of measurement across different data sources.
String manipulation: Formatting text data for consistency (e.g., trimming spaces, converting to uppercase or lowercase).
Data Structuring:

Joining datasets: Combining data from multiple sources based on common attributes.
Splitting datasets: Dividing datasets into smaller, more manageable subsets.
Pivoting: Reshaping data from a wide to a long format or vice versa.
Aggregation: Summarizing data by applying functions like sum, count, average, etc.
Data Validation:

Enforcing data constraints: Applying rules to ensure data quality and integrity (e.g., value ranges, data types, format restrictions).
Detecting and flagging errors: Identifying data that violates validation rules.
Data Enrichment:

Adding new attributes: Deriving new information from existing data or incorporating external data sources.
Standardizing codes and values: Resolving inconsistencies in coding systems between different data sources.
Data Masking or Anonymization:

Protecting sensitive data: Obscuring or removing personally identifiable information (PII) to comply with privacy regulations.
Additional Transformations:

Filtering: Selecting specific rows of data based on certain criteria.
Sorting: Arranging data in a specific order.
Deduplication: Identifying and removing duplicate records.
Data masking or anonymization: Protecting sensitive data for privacy and security.
